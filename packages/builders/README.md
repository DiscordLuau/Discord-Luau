## DiscordLuau - Builders

This package is a collection of builders that can be used to create Objects that can be parsed by the Discord API.

---

Builders take the following approach:
- Support the creation of new Builders which represent structures the Discord API understands.
- Support the modification of existing data structures that the Discord API understands.

Builders should cover both the creation and modification of discord data structures.
