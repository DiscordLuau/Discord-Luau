## About

This is the **[Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) [Wrapper](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/api-wrapper/)**, the resource that you'll be interacting with if you want to create a Discord Bot/Application! ðŸŽ‰

### Project Status

This project is undergoing a major change to the structure, breaking the project down into several packages instead of a single package.

If you'd like to reach out to me, i'm available in the [Roblox OSS discord.](https://discord.gg/V3HZe4H75u), specifically in the `#discord-luau` channel under #projects.
